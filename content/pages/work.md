###EDUCATION

**M.S. COMPUTER SCIENCE, Rutgers University, Sept '07 - Dec '09**

My interest in data mining and web data started here. Most of my work at Rutgers focused on web data management, improving clustering techniques in very large databases, research on Micro-formats and XML on web data to name a few. Implemented recommendation/search engines and web services in Java and Python.

**B.TECH COMPUTER SCIENCE, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Aug '02 - May '06**

I learnt everything from operating system kernels to cluster computing here. I had the wonderful opputunity to build a 32 node cluster in the summer of 2005 with the help of Hari Pyla, my mentor. My undergrad thesis received Best Undergraduate Project of the year.
